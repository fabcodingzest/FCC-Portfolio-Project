              My name is Fab. I am a girl teaching herself to code online with
              the help of available resources on Internet and sharing my journey
              online on Instagram and Twitter with the awesome Dev Commuity
              online.

              I was always interested in computers from a young age but never
              got into programming until 2017 after High School ended. For the
              very first time I tried learning C++ but I had University
              Admissions going on so after a couple of months I had to quit
              because in reality I wasnt finding C++ that much interesting at
              that moment. After getting into Uni in Bachelors of technology
              with Computer Science I was doing what any other student would do
              - the college hustle with travel, attendance, assignments, exams
              etc etc etc. I wasn't getting any value there so I decided to drop
              out in Jan 2018 after first semester and I never regretted that
              decision.

              I got into distant education program immediately where I just had
              to attend classes on weekends only and had all the time left to
              study and explore. I have tried many things and institutes for
              learning different things but I only got satisfied with online up
              to date resources so in 2019, I started my Web Dev journey with
              Udemy, Youtube, Freecodecamp and other resources and I'm really
              happy to see the result of my code onscreen. I am now learning and
              building Front end stuff daily to improve my skills. I work with
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React mostly along with other tools
              available like webpack, babel, npm, git and Github.

              So that was my Story ! <br />I am sorry if that was boring but I
              wanted to share thow I ended up coding🤗❤
